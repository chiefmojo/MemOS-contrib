/**
 * `gain-repair.ts` — WP #272 §5 per-policy attempt engine (Phase C).
 *
 * Used ONLY by the repair timer (core/pipeline/memory-core.ts); ordinary L2,
 * preview and rollback never call it. The engine owns the durable total-attempt
 * budget (kv, `pipeline.<name>.v1` — no separate budget table), the per-policy
 * reservation + recompute transactions, the interrupted-claim reconcile and the
 * config-generation re-screen. Policy field writes happen here (under a short
 * per-policy transaction) — that is the Phase C exception to the
 * "transaction layer owns policy writes" rule, because the timer has no other
 * transaction layer of its own.
 *
 * Atomicity contract (spec §5):
 *
 *   • Reservation (one tx): read budget from kv, refuse when the absolute
 *     ceiling is exhausted, claim the queue entry, increment the budget and
 *     journal an attempt/claim (`result='pending'`) — ALL before any repair
 *     work. A crash after reservation consumes that attempt; the next tick's
 *     interrupted-claim reconcile resets the queue entry to `pending` and marks
 *     the orphaned journal row `failed` WITHOUT replaying a committed repair.
 *     Any retry is a new budgeted attempt.
 *
 *   • Per-policy transaction (one tx): re-read the policy + evidence fresh
 *     (no review-token/fingerprint scheme), detect concurrent policy changes
 *     (journal `conflicted`, leave pending, never overwrite), recompute gain
 *     via the shared §3 helper, then commit policy fields + final queue state
 *     + journal outcome together. `unknown_owner` / `no_resolved_with` become
 *     `blocked` (budget consumed, policy never mutated). Active policies never
 *     archive; support never increments; no LLM calls; no synthetic L2 events.
 *
 * Outcomes consume budget: blocked, conflicted and failed. Natural-touch
 * reconciliation (already-v2 / already-repaired rows) and ordinary L2
 * updates/promotions do NOT consume budget. Re-screen never consumes budget
 * and never writes policy fields.
