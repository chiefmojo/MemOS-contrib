/**
 * `recompute-gain.ts` — WP #272 §3 shared evidence selection + gain recomputation.
 *
 * One selection/computation core shared by ordinary L2 (`runL2`), the read-only
 * `policies.gainPreview` RPC (Phase D) and the timer repair engine (Phase C).
 * The transaction layer owns policy writes, support accounting, queue progress
 * and journal insertion; this module owns none of them.
 *
 * Selection contract (§3 of the WP #272 design):
 *
 *   1. Union persisted with-links (`tracePolicyLinks`), current-run with
 *      evidence (current associations + induction evidence) and current-run
 *      traces.
 *   2. Include directly-linked traces even if older than their episode's
 *      newest 50; include current-run traces and the newest 50 persisted
 *      traces per linked episode — read from `episodes.trace_ids_json` (the
 *      exact reward-pass set), never a scan of all rows sharing `episode_id`.
 *   3. Deduplicate by ID, sort timestamp DESC then ID DESC.
 *   4. Exclude NULL-score traces BEFORE the final 50-with / 50-without limits
 *      and count them as `excluded.unresolved{With,Without}`. Dangling IDs,
 *      invalid scores and out-of-namespace rows are reported separately. The
 *      pool is never refilled by scanning older unrelated traces.
 *   5. Resolved zeros are kept, including without-traces; zero is valid
 *      evidence.
 *   6. Compute whenever ≥ 1 resolved with-trace remains; an empty resolved
 *      without-set uses the existing prior. Skip (preserving previous policy
 *      state) for no resolved with-evidence — exclusion, not skip-of-policy,
 *      is the rule whenever a resolved with-trace remains.
 *
 * v2 certification: `isFirst = support == 0 OR gain_version != 2` → the raw
 * first-v2 gain is used and the EMA is reset. An inference-rule-refresh
 * recompute (`mode === "inference_refresh"` / `resetEma`) also resets the EMA
 * so a superseded inferred score never blends into its replacement. Later
 * ordinary v2 updates keep the EMA (baseline, 5 pseudocounts, softmax-with-set
 * mean for ≥ 3 samples, arithmetic mean otherwise, existing coefficient).
 * Historical repair never increments support nor repeatedly EMAs unchanged
 * evidence — support accounting stays in the transaction layer.
 *
 * Owner isolation: evidence traces are matched against the POLICY's owner
 * fields (falling back to the caller's exact namespace). NULL / `unknown`
 * owner traces are the shared space in this codebase (`visibilityWhere` treats
 * `owner_agent_kind IS NULL` / `'unknown'` as visible to everyone) — matching
 * them is not borrowing another owner's evidence. A trace that carries a REAL
 * owner different from the policy owner is counted as out-of-namespace and
 * excluded. Unknown-owner policies are reported (`unknownOwner`) and excluded
 * from automatic mutation by repair callers.
 *
 * This module performs NO writes: it never deletes links, never changes
 * support, never replaces NULL with zero, and never certifies excluded traces.

/**
 * A trace is borrowed evidence only when it carries a REAL owner that differs

 * Exported for the Phase C re-screen requeue, which must apply the SAME
 * resolved-evidence predicate as this module's union reconcile.
